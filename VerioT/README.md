# VerioT
The VerioT.py is the source code of our tool VerioT. 
The source code of the base model is in the "baseModel" folder. 
The delegation operation templates are listed in the "templates" folder. 
In "Example" folder, we illustrate the delegation settings and verification results of real-world IoT delegation (Flaw 1, 2, 3 and 5 in our paper), including the configuration file (the delegation setting), the generated model and the flaw report output by VerioT.
More details and instructions will be uploaded/updated later.
